        <h1>General terms and Conditions for Online Advertising</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Subject matter and scope</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          1.1 These General Terms and Conditions (“GT &amp;Cs”) are valid for
          all commercial relationships between MotorHub and advertising clients
          and advertising agencies (“Client” or “Clients”) regarding the
          provision of online marketing services (“Online Advertising”) and
          related services by MotorHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.2 General terms and conditions or other standard contract terms of
          the Client or third parties shall have no validity, even if MotorHub
          does not object to them expressly in individual cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Conclusion of contract</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          2.1 A contract between MotorHub and the Client on the rendering of
          online advertising services including special advertising forms and
          related services (if applicable) shall come into being when MotorHub
          accepts a written offer submitted by the Client on the basis of a
          proposal, always non-binding, from MotorHub (“individual contract”).
          The declaration of acceptance need not reach the Client. The specific
          individual contract in question shall contain the respective scope of
          performance and the contractual terms as harmonised with the
          circumstances of each individual case. If the provisions of an
          individual contract diverge from those of these GT &amp;Cs, the
          provisions of the individual contract shall take precedence.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.2 If the Client is an advertising agency, MotorHub will conclude the
          contract with it only if the advertising client for whom the agency is
          placing the ad with MotorHub is specified by name. The same shall
          apply if the Client wants to conclude the contract with MotorHub via
          an advertising intermediary not acting in his/her own name. In all
          cases, MotorHub shall be entitled to demand from the advertising
          intermediary proof of his/her being instructed to carry out the
          transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.3 In the event of MotorHub rejecting an offer from a client to
          conclude a contract concerning online advertising, MotorHub shall
          notify the respective client of this without undue delay.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.4 The cancellation of an order requires at least text form. If a
          cancellation request arrives immediately before the beginning, or
          after the start, of the agreed advertising campaign, MotorHub will
          stop resp. end the advertising campaign without undue delay upon
          receiving the cancellation request, usually within 72 hours of its
          receipt. The cancellation of an order up to two weeks before the
          launch date is free of charge. The day on which the advertising
          campaign is first placed online is regarded as the launch date. For
          more short-termed cancellation requests resp. cancellation requests
          after the launch date, MotorHub shall have the right to invoice the
          Client for damages as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          a) In case of cancellation less than 2 weeks before the agreed launch
          date: 30 % of the net invoice value.
        </p>
        <p>
          b) In case of cancellation after the agreed launch date: 50 % of the
          net invoice value still outstanding at the time when the advertising
          campaign is stopped. Additionally, the Client will be invoiced for the
          price of the online advertising already rendered. Where applicable,
          the price will be based on the discount rate for the lesser volume
          (see Section 6).
        </p>
        <p>
          2.5 MotorHub will, as a general rule, only accept offers for online
          advertising in the minimum order amount of 3.50 EUR net invoice value.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Duties of the Client</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          3.1 The Client must check the legality of the information, data,
          files, content and other material (hereinafter referred to as
          “Advertising Material”), including links to advertising material on
          other websites and shall assume sole responsibility for the legality
          of the advertising material made available for publication.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.2 The Client shall be obliged to design and structure the
          advertising material in such a way that it does not infringe legal
          provisions, official prohibitions or public morality. In particular,
          the Client shall not deliver advertising material which
          <br />
          contains pornographic content as defined by the applicable laws;
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            constitutes an inadmissible offering as defined by the applicable
            laws on protection of minors;
          </li>
          <li>
            constitutes an offering which impairs young people's development as
            defined by the applicable laws on protection of minors;
          </li>
          <li>
            contains inadmissible propaganda material as defined by the
            applicable laws or characteristics of unconstitutional organisations
            as defined by the applicable laws;
          </li>
          <li>
            contains representations inciting hatred and violence against
            specific groups or glorifying violence as defined by the applicable
            laws;
          </li>
          <li>
            incites racial hatred, glorifies war or promotes a terrorist
            organisation;
          </li>
          <li>invites people to break the law;</li>
          <li>
            contains insulting and/or defamatory remarks and/or representations;
          </li>
          <li>is contrary to fair competition;</li>
          <li>contains viruses, trojans, spyware or other malware,</li>
          <li>
            contains illegal content of some other kind, or is generally suited
            to damaging the reputation of MotorHub or an affiliate of MotorHub..
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          3.3 The Client shall ensure that the above are complied with and gives
          his assurance that the advertising material that it delivers is free
          of any third-party rights which present an obstacle to use as defined
          by the contract and of any other third-party rights, in particular
          trademark rights, patent rights or copyright. This refers particularly
          to the Client's being entitled to the rights of use (Section 7) to the
          advertising material supplied and intended for publication in
          accordance with this contract for the intended type of realisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.4 The Client shall ensure that the above is complied with and gives
          his assurance that he is entitled to use any links to other content
          that may be integrated into his advertising material.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.5 The Client undertakes to supply the advertising material necessary
          for the online advertising at his own expense up until such time as is
          agreed in the individual contract or - should no time be agreed in the
          individual contract - until no later than five working days before the
          agreed publication date, and in complete and perfect condition and in
          accordance with the contractual agreements. The Client undertakes to
          ensure that the advertising material is suitable for the agreed
          purposes, in particular for the screen presentation in the appropriate
          environment and that it is of the type and size agreed in the
          individual contract. The advertising material must - unless otherwise
          agreed with regard to Third-Party Inventory - correspond to the
          technical specifications for Google Marketing Platform that are
          relevant in each case. The Client can receive these from MotorHub on
          request. Insofar as links are contained in the advertising material
          provided, the Client must indicate the respective target addresses
          (URL) of the links in advance. If the Client does not comply with the
          agreed date and the online advertising and/or related services (if
          applicable) can be published or performed only with a delay or not at
          all, this shall not impair MotorHub's claim to the full payment of the
          agreed remuneration. In cases where it is no longer possible to
          publish the online advertising or perform the related services (if
          applicable), MotorHub must take into account amounts which it saves as
          a result of its exemption from performance or which it acquires or
          culpably fails to acquire as a result of the alternative use of the
          freed resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Client further undertakes not to collect or retrieve any
          information (incl. data), either personally or through an unauthorized
          third party, and/or to intercept or let a third party intercept any
          program operated by MotorHub or its Affiliates of and/or to hack or
          let a third party hack into any data network operated by MotorHub or
          its Affiliates. This also applies to programs and data networks of the
          partners commissioned by MotorHub with the marketing of Third-Party
          Inventory as well as the providers of this Third-Party Inventory
          (together "Third-Party Inventory Partners").
        </p>
        <p>
          3.6 Each of the parties shall specify to the other party an employee
          of its own as the contact person for all questions that arise in
          connection with the rendering of the online advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.7 The Client is obliged to perform effective maintenance of the URLs
          he has specified to which the online advertising is intended to be
          linked for the duration of the online advertising placement period. He
          shall ensure that the Internet pages and documents to which links are
          provided can be accessed in accordance with the state of the art for
          the duration of the online advertising placement period. If one of the
          parties discovers a fault in the linking of the online advertising, it
          shall inform the other party of this without undue delay. MotorHub can
          suspend the placement of the online advertising for the duration of
          the linking fault if this fault was caused by the Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.8 If the Client provides advertising material by means of a
          Redirect, the Client shall not change or exchange the advertising
          material unless the Client has discussed the change or exchange with
          MotorHub and has obtained a prior written approval (e-mail is
          sufficient) from MotorHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.9 The Client may use browser cookies purposed for the tracking of
          impressions, conversion and view-time data. Browser cookies utilised
          for any other purpose are only permitted with explicit prior written
          consent of MotorHub (email is sufficient). Locally Shared
          Objects/Flash Cookies (LSO/FSO), Document Object Model (DOM) storage
          or other means of collecting and tracking both personal data and
          non-personal data are explicitly prohibited. The Client may use a
          third party vendor to collect the above mentioned data through smart
          tags or cookie dropping on the Advertising Space only for the agreed
          advertising campaigns and only if prior written consent has been
          granted by MotorHub. Data collected through the use of cookies on the
          MotorHub Website and associated websites and on the Third-Party
          Inventory belongs to MotorHub and shall therefore not be used for
          purposes other than mentioned in Sentence 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          3.10 If the Client performs his cooperation duties either only partly
          or not at all, MotorHub's obligation to render those services that can
          be rendered either not at all or only at unreasonable additional
          expense without the fulfilment of the Client's cooperation duties
          shall be suspended for the duration of the Client's non-performance.
          Any additional expense resulting from the Client's non-performance of
          his cooperation duties must be paid by the Client in accordance with
          the prices agreed in the contract in question, or, if no prices are
          stipulated there, on a time basis in accordance with the general
          MotorHub rates applicable at the time when the expense was incurred.
          Outlays must be reimbursed. In any event, any legal rights of MotorHub
          to cancel or rescind the contract shall remain unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4. Services rendered by MotorHub</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          4.1 MotorHub shall, subject to these GT &amp;Cs, deliver the
          advertising material made available and specified for publication by
          the Client under the individual contract in question in the
          contractually agreed scope and for the contractually agreed period.
          MotorHub shall be entitled to edit the advertising material with
          regard to its format, size and technical properties insofar as
          MotorHub regard this as necessary for the delivery of the advertising
          material and reasonable for the Client in consideration of MotorHub's
          interests. If MotorHub regards it as necessary to edit the content of
          the advertising material (e.g. due to the illegality of some or all
          content), MotorHub shall obtain the Client's consent to this course of
          action. Any delays in the rendering of MotorHub's services that result
          from this shall be the responsibility of the Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2 The placement of the online advertising shall be made only for the
          period agreed in the individual contract and/or until the maximum
          number of ad impressions (Internet users' visual contact with the
          online advertising), page impressions (retrievals of the Internet page
          on which the online advertising is placed), ad clicks (Internet users'
          clicks on the online advertising) or other results specified in that
          individual contract ("Other Results") has been reached. Unless
          provided otherwise in the individual contract the parties may agree on
          changes to the agreed period of delivery in text form.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3 Insofar as MotorHub has assured the Client that it will deliver a
          particular number of ad impressions, page impressions, ad clicks or
          Other Results within a particular period for an item of online
          advertising and the number thus assured was not delivered in full
          during this period, MotorHub shall be entitled, but not obliged, to
          carry on placing the online advertising in question and subsequently
          deliver the still missing number of ad impressions, page impressions,
          ad clicks or Other Results. The deadlines for such delayed deliveries
          shall be coordinated with the Client taking the legitimate interests
          of both parties into account.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the agreed number is not delivered subsequently within the period
          allowed for delayed delivery, the Client shall be entitled to reduce
          the remuneration proportionally for the ad impressions, page
          impressions, ad clicks and Other Results that were not delivered.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.4 If MotorHub and the Client have agreed to include targeted
          advertising (retargeting) in the advertising campaign, MotorHub shall
          only be obliged to try accomplishing the repeated approach of
          customers who visited the Client's advertising website/s in accordance
          with the terms of the individual contract. Terms on success of
          retargeting contained in an individual contract are non-binding for
          MotorHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.5 The Client, notwithstanding any divergent agreement contained in
          the individual contract in question, shall have no claim to a delivery
          of the advertising material at particular placements. If MotorHub
          modifies or abandons certain media formats and placements,
          respectively, or introduces new media formats or placements, MotorHub
          shall be entitled to exchange such media formats or placements against
          other media formats or placements with the same overall ad volume.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.6 Insofar as the advertising material determined and handed over for
          publication by the Client is not clearly recognisable as advertising,
          MotorHub shall be entitled to identify the material as advertising,
          and in particular to label it with the word „Advertisement“ or similar
          indications and/or to separate it spatially from any editorial content
          also on hand in order to make clear its advertising character.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.7 MotorHub shall not be obliged to hand over the advertising
          material delivered for the realisation of the online advertising to
          the Client upon termination of the online advertising or to retain it.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.8 MotorHub shall not be obliged to create graphics or advertising
          copy for the Client. Insofar as MotorHub renders services of this kind
          on the basis of an individual agreement in the respective individual
          contract, these services must be remunerated separately on the basis
          of the hourly rates agreed in the individual contract or, if no such
          agreements exist, on the basis of MotorHub's currently valid hourly
          rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.9 MotorHub shall be entitled to postpone or cancel altogether an
          agreed date for the publication of an item of online advertising if a
          service within whose scope the publication is supposed to take place
          is not offered on the agreed date or if technical circumstances
          prevent publication on the agreed date, provided that MotorHub was not
          responsible for such obstacles arising. If it is possible to postpone
          the placement until a later date, MotorHub shall give due
          consideration to the Client's interests of which it is aware as far as
          is reasonable and possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.10 If MotorHub and the Client agree on special advertising formats
          (“Partner Portal” or “Content Special”) the following terms shall
          apply in addition to these GT &amp;C:
        </p>
        <p>
          a) If MotorHub and the Client have agreed by individual contract on
          the delivery of a Partner Portal, MotorHub shall provide the Client
          for the duration of the contract term with an inline frame (“iframe”)
          which will be hosted by the Client and integrated by MotorHub into the
          MotorHub Website as agreed between the parties. The integration of the
          advertising material into the iframe shall be done by the Client and
          upon its sole responsibility. MotorHub has no access to the
          advertising material. The Client's obligations pursuant to Section 3
          of these GT &amp;C shall apply accordingly. If the Client (or, in case
          that the Client is an advertising agency, the advertiser which has
          engaged the Client) is a registered user of the MotorHub Website, the
          Client (or advertiser) shall be entitled to link from the Partner
          Portal to listings of its MotorHub Websites, eBay Kleinanzeigen
          Website account or to display these listings in the Partner Portal.
          The Client agrees to make an imprint publicly available on the Partner
          Portal during the entire contract term in accordance with the
          regulations of Art. 5 of the EU Directive on electronic commerce
          (2000/31/EC) and the applicable local laws and regulations. If the
          Partner Portal enables users to enter user data and to pass it on to
          the Client (or, in case that the Client is an advertising agency, to
          the advertiser which has engaged the Client), the Client shall be
          liable to MotorHub, irrespective of fault, for the observance of any
          applicable laws and regulations, in particular but not limited to data
          protection laws. The Client shall be solely responsible for the
          communication with users regarding any inquiries as to the Partner
          Portal and any goods and services offered or promoted on the Partner
          Portal, as well as for the due performance of the agreements made
          between the user and the Client (or, in case that the Client is an
          advertising agency, the advertiser which has engaged the Client).
          Section 8 of these GT &amp;C shall apply accordingly. If MotorHub and
          the Client agree on the delivery of additional online media for the
          promotion of the Partner Portal, all media shall link to the Partner
          Portal unless otherwise agreed in writing (e-mail is sufficient).
        </p>
        <p>
          b) If MotorHub and the Client have agreed by individual contract on
          the delivery of a Content Special, MotorHub shall ensure for the
          duration of the contract term the integration of a theme site
          featuring editorial content which shall be accessible by users through
          the MotorHub Websitesas agreed between the parties. The contents of
          the Content Special will be produced and integrated by MotorHub at its
          own cost and with free editorial discretion. The style and layout of
          the Content Special are subject to MotorHub's free discretion having
          regard to the Client's legitimate interests (or the advertiser's
          legitimate interests if the Client is an advertising agency). If
          MotorHub and the Client agree on the delivery of additional online
          media for the pro­motion of the Content Special, all media shall link
          to the Client's website (or the advertiser's website if the Client is
          an advertising agency) unless otherwise agreed in writing (e-mail is
          sufficient).
        </p>

          <strong>5. Rejection or discontinuation of online advertising</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          5.1 MotorHub shall be entitled to either wholly or partly reject
          advertising material submitted by the Client for publication if such
          material contains illegal or immoral content as defined by Section 3.2
          or infringes the rights of third parties as defined by Section 3.3.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.2 Section 5.1 shall also apply if the advertising material is not
          supplied to MotorHub by the Client for the purpose of placement on the
          Advertising Space, but is instead made available by the Client on a
          different ad server chosen by the Client and is integrated into the
          Advertising Space only via a link. The Client may not alter or replace
          such advertising material without the prior consent of MotorHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.3 MotorHub shall also be entitled, under the preconditions in
          Section 5.1, to remove either temporarily or permanently, either
          wholly or partly, advertising material already published, or in the
          case of Section 5.2 to disable the relevant link. This shall also
          apply if the Client subsequently alters advertising material that has
          already been published and the prerequisites in Section 5.1 have been
          satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.4 If there is reasonable suspicion that the advertising material
          provided by the Client has illegal content as defined by Section 3.2
          or infringes third-party rights as defined by Section 3.3, MotorHub
          shall be entitled to reject the online advertising or discontinue its
          publication until a statement has been made by the Client and the
          matter has been cleared up, or until the Client succeeds in dispelling
          the suspicion. A reasonable suspicion in this sense shall apply in
          particular when such a suspicion has been induced by official
          proceedings or by a criminal investigation or when there are
          comprehensible grounds for believing that such proceedings will soon
          be initiated. The same shall also apply if MotorHub, an Affiliate
          and/or a Third-Party Inventory Partner is requested by a third party
          to refrain from any further placement of the online advertising
          because it is illegal or immoral or infringes third-party rights,
          provided that the third party's claim is not clearly, and for MotorHub
          recognisably, unfounded. MotorHub shall notify the Client of the
          rejection or blocking of the online advertising without undue delay
          and specify the reasons for this course of action.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.5 Sections 5.1 to 5.4 shall apply accordingly if the advertising
          material provided and intended for publication by the Client contains
          links to illegal or immoral content as defined by Section 3.2 or to
          content that infringes third-party rights as defined by Section 3.3.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.6 MotorHub also reserves the right to reject particular forms of
          online advertising on grounds of its content, its origins or its
          technical quality on the basis of uniform, factually justified
          principles if their placement is unreasonable for MotorHub, one of its
          Affiliates or a Third-Party Inventory Partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.7 There shall be no obligation for MotorHub to check the advertising
          material or the links referred to by the advertising material,
          including the content of those links. Any checks carried out by
          MotorHub shall not release the Client from his responsibility for the
          advertising material and/or the links referred to by the advertising
          material, including the content of those links.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>6. Remuneration, settlement, taxes</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          6.1 The remuneration to be paid by the Client for MotorHub's services
          shall ensue from the individual contract between MotorHub and the
          Client that is agreed in each case.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.2 Insofar as the remuneration is calculated on the basis of TCP
          (thousand contact price, calculated per 1000 page impressions or ad
          impressions) or per ad click (cost per click = CPC), MotorHub shall
          inform the Client on request about the relevant number of ad
          impressions, page impressions or ad clicks and the click rate (= ratio
          of ad clicks to ad impressions or page impressions) for those
          Advertising Space on which the Client's online advertising is placed.
          With regard to Other Results, the numbers to be provided by MotorHub
          are set forth in the respective individual contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.3 The sole authoritative factor for the counting of the quantity of
          ad impressions, page impressions, ad clicks or Other Results delivered
          to the advertising client, as well as the click rate, shall be
          MotorHub’s reporting activities (recorded by MotorHub's ad server) or,
          where applicable, the reporting of a service provider engaged by
          MotorHub (like, for example, an SSP operator) or a Third-Party
          Inventory Partner. If the advertising client has counted divergent
          quantities of ad impressions, page impressions, ad clicks, Other
          Results or click rates with its own ad server, these shall not be
          taken into account.
        </p>
        <p>
          a) If the relevant business units are unable to agree within fifteen
          days on the definitive quantity counted, they shall refer the dispute
          to the parties' respective management bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          b) The limitation of the right of action arising from the commercial
          situation being dealt with by arbitration shall be suspended from time
          of the arbitration request until the end of the conciliation
          proceedings.
        </p>
        <p>
          c) If one of the parties is dissatisfied with the arbitration decision
          made by the arbitration board, it can reject the arbitration board and
          assert its claims before a court.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.4 The remuneration for targeted advertising (retargeting) shall be
          calculated on the basis of successful repeated approaches of
          customers. The sole authoritative factor for the counting of repeated
          approaches shall be MotorHub's reporting activities (recorded by
          MotorHub's ad server).
        </p>
        <p>
          6.5 Unless otherwise agreed in an individual contract, MotorHub shall
          charge the agreed remuneration for the services rendered after the
          online advertising in question has come to an end. If the term of the
          online advertising is longer than one month and monthly remuneration
          has been agreed, MotorHub can charge the agreed remuneration at the
          end of the respective month. The agreed sum shall be payable on issue
          of the invoice and must be transferred without deductions to an
          account to be specified by MotorHub within 30 (thirty) days. If the
          Client fails to pay by the due date, the Client shall pay any dunning
          and processing costs incurred. In other respects, the legal provisions
          on default shall apply.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.6 MotorHub reserves the right to demand payment in advance from
          Clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.7 The Client may set off its own claims against claims by MotorHub
          only if such claims have been recognised by MotorHub or by declaratory
          judgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.8 MotorHub reserves the right to grant individual clients a discount
          in writing when a particular booking volume has been reached.
        </p>
        <p>
          a) If the discount is granted on the basis of a booking volume to be
          achieved per month, the discount shall be included in the monthly
          invoice in question and granted for the entire monthly booking volume.
        </p>
        <p>
          b) If the Client is granted a discount in the event of its achieving a
          particular booking volume for a period longer than one month (e.g. one
          year), the Client, on achievement of the booking volume in question,
          shall receive the discount solely for the booking volume which exceeds
          the agreed limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          c) If the Client, in derogation of Section 6.8 (b), is granted a
          discount by MotorHub at the time of the first ad booking on the basis
          that the Client, within a defined period, reaches a booking volume
          liable to an aggregate discount, the Client undertakes to pay back the
          amount saved via the discount if it proves unable to generate the
          originally agreed booking volume by the end of the agreed period.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.9 MotorHub shall not grant the discount arrangement specified above
          in the case of ad placement collectives. Ad placement collectives
          shall be held to apply when various companies operate together under a
          single advertising client's name or a single advertising agency when
          booking services from MotorHub. This provision shall also apply if the
          different companies all belong to the same group. If the existence of
          an ad placement collective does not become known until MotorHub has
          already granted a discount, MotorHub can demand the repayment of the
          discount that had erroneously been granted.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.10 All agreed prices are strictly net and must be paid plus the
          statutory rate of VAT to MotorHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>7. Grants of rights</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          7.1 The Client hereby grants MotorHub and its Affiliates for the
          purposes of this contract and limited to the contractual term agreed
          in the respective individual contract, the non-exclusive, worldwide
          right, including the right to transfer or grant sublicenses to third
          parties for the purpose of providing the contractual services and to
          Affiliates, to integrate the advertising material handed over to
          MotorHub within the scope of the online advertising activities and
          potential related services into the Advertising Space to present and
          publish it there and to make it accessible and transmit it to the
          general public and closed user groups via fixed and mobile
          communications networks in places and at times of their choice for the
          purpose of simultaneous or successive use - also readily retrievable -
          and to reproduce the advertising material for the above purposes. The
          Client further grants MotorHub and its Affiliates the right to use the
          advertising material for purposes of self-marketing, research and/or
          training including, without limitation, the use for sales records and
          presentations, industry events, market research studies related to
          advertising campaigns, campaign evaluations, training of employees as
          well as the use on websites operated by MotorHub and/or its
          Affiliates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The above granting of rights shall also encompass, in particular, the
          right to use the advertising material and, as the case may be, other
          material:
        </p>
        <p>
          a) within the scope of telecommunications, tele- and media services,
          (e.g. online services, electronic push-and-pull services such as
          e-mail, SMS, MMS);
          <br />
          b) in each case including all digital and analogue transmission and
          retrieval technologies, particularly via cable, radio, fixed and
          mobile satellite networks and microwaves using all methods (in
          particular GSM, GPRS, UMTS, WAN, LAN, WLAN, broadband, etc.);
          <br />
          c) utilising all protocols and languages (in particular TCP-IP, IP,
          HTTP, WAP, HTML, c-HTML, XML etc.);
          <br />
          d) including reproduction, downloading and storing on any receiver
          equipment such as, in particular, stationary and mobile computers,
          television sets, set-top boxes, (hard-disk) video recorders, mobile
          phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs);
          <br />
          and including
          <br />
          e) the right to edit the advertising material and, as the case may be,
          other material in accordance with the provisions of this contract and
          to use these edited versions in accordance with this Section 7 and
        </p>
        <p>
          7.2 The above granting of rights also refers, in particular, to
          existing copyrights and ancillary copyrights applicable to the
          advertising material and other material, privilege as to one's own
          image, rights to bear names and titles, trademark rights and other
          identification rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>8. Indemnity against claims by third parties</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Insofar as third parties, including organs of the state (e.g.
          prosecuting authorities), assert claims against MotorHub, its
          Affiliates and/or Third-Party Inventory Partner on grounds of an
          infringement (a) of Section 3.2, (b) of industrial property rights
          (e.g. patent or trademark rights), copyright or other rights (e.g.
          privilege as to one’s own image) or (c) legal provisions (e.g.
          criminal law, youth protection law, unfair competition law) as a
          result of the use in conformity with the contract of the advertising
          material provided and intended for publishing in the online
          advertising campaign by the Client and/or as a result of the content
          of the Internet pages and documents to which this advertising material
          was linked in accordance with the URLs specified by the Client, the
          Client undertakes to exempt MotorHub, its Affiliates and/or
          Third-Party Inventory Partners fully from these claims (in the amount
          of the ordered fine or pecuniary penalty ordered in the case of
          infringement of public regulations) and from the reasonable costs of a
          legal dispute and legal defence (including costs of legal advice and
          representation). The obligation to indemnify is subject to the
          condition that MotorHub, its Affiliates and/or the Third-Party
          Inventory Partner neither acknowledge third-party claims of this kind
          without the Client's consent nor reach any settlement on the matter in
          question with the third party. The Client, however, may refuse his
          consent only for good cause. This obligation to exempt shall not apply
          if the Client was not responsible for the infringement as per Sections
          (a) or (b). The limitations on liability in Section 10 shall not apply
          for this obligation to exempt. Any compensation claims asserted on
          grounds of loss or damage going beyond this shall remain unaffected by
          the above.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>9. Warranty / Force majeure</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          9.1 MotorHub shall make the MotorHub Website available for the online
          advertising in accordance with the current state of the art.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.2 MotorHub is entitled to temporarily restrict the availability of
          the MotorHub Website if this is necessary due to capacity limits, the
          security or integrity of the servers, or in order to carry out
          technical measures, and provided that the restriction serves the
          proper or improved rendering of the services (maintenance work). In
          such cases, MotorHub shall take account of the Client's legitimate
          interests, e.g. by providing advance information. In the case of
          online advertising on Third-Party Inventory, the obligation of
          MotorHub is limited to the forwarding of any advance information
          received from the Third-Party Inventory Partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.3 All of the services offered on the Internet can be impaired by, in
          particular, technical circumstances, failures of productivity and/or
          connections, hardware and software defects and the influence of third
          parties whose actions cannot be attributed to MotorHub (e.g. as a
          result of viruses or services attacks). The parties are agreed that
          breakdowns and/or faults in the rendering of services caused by such
          occurrences for which MotorHub were not responsible shall not
          constitute any rights for the Client.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.4 Each of the two parties shall be released from its obligations to
          perform if the rendering of their performance temporarily becomes
          impossible on grounds of force majeure. Force majeure shall be
          regarded as all events which, even with the utmost care that can
          reasonably be expected, could not be foreseen and averted by the party
          prevented from rendering the performances in question, e.g. war, civil
          disorders, natural disasters, fire, sabotage by third parties, and
          strikes in areas for whose smooth functioning the affected party is
          not responsible. The release from obligations to perform shall apply
          only for the duration of the hindrance. If it is no longer possible
          for MotorHub to render the services at a later date when the hindrance
          has ceased to apply (e.g. because the booked placements have then been
          booked by another client), or if the hindrance through force majeure
          lasts longer than fourteen days, each of the two parties shall be
          entitled to cancel the individual contract in question without notice
          or withdraw from it for good cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          9.5 The Client shall be obliged to check the online advertising and,
          as the case may be, related services without undue delay after its
          publication and to notify MotorHub in writing of any discernible
          errors without undue delay but no later than one week after
          publication and/or performance. If the Client fails to provide
          notification in this way, the online advertising and/or related
          services shall be regarded as approved in accordance with the
          contract, unless the error was not discernible at the time of the
          check. If an error in the online advertising and/or related services
          becomes apparent at a later date, the Client must give notification of
          it without undue delay upon its discovery, otherwise the online
          advertising and/or related services shall be deemed approved even in
          consideration of this error.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>10. Liability</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          10.1 The parties shall be liable vis-à-vis one another for loss or
          damage in accordance with the relevant legal provisions, except in the
          case of violations of material contractual obligations, only if and
          insofar as the parties, their legal representatives, senior employees
          or other vicarious agents are guilty of intent or gross negligence. If
          material contractual duties are violated, the parties shall be held
          liable for all culpable behaviour by the parties, their legal
          representatives, senior employees or other vicarious agents. The term
          "material contractual obligations" refers to those obligations whose
          fulfilment is essential for the proper execution of the contract,
          whose fulfilment the contractual partner may regularly rely on and
          whose violation endangers the achievement of the purpose of the
          contract
        </p>
        <p>
          10.2 Except in the case of intent or gross negligence by the parties,
          their legal representatives, senior employees or other vicarious
          agents, the liability of the parties as regards the amount shall be
          limited to the loss or damage typically incurred in transactions of
          this kind that could be foreseen when the contract was concluded.
        </p>
        <p>
          10.3 Except in the case of intent or gross negligence by the parties,
          their legal representatives, senior employees or other vicarious
          agents, the liability of the parties for indirect loss or damage,
          particularly lost profits, shall for each damaging event be restricted
          to the amount of remuneration that the Client was obliged to pay
          MotorHub for online advertising during the last six months preceding
          the damaging event.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>11. Confidentiality</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          11.1 The parties undertake to treat as strictly confidential during
          the term of this contract and for three years after its termination
          all information received from the other party about its affairs and
          all information that comes to their attention relating to the other
          party in connection with the implementation of this agreement,
          particularly customer and product data, technical data such as
          computer programs and interfaces, and financial data such as the other
          party's sales figures, margins and purchasing terms („confidential
          information“), to use it only for the purpose of implementing this
          contract and not to make it accessible to third parties. The content
          of this agreement, too, must be treated confidentially. Each of the
          parties is obliged to consult the other party if any doubts emerge as
          to whether a specific piece of information is to be treated
          confidentially. With regard to the secrecy of confidential
          information, the receiving party shall exercise the same care and use
          the same safeguards that it uses to protect its own confidential
          information of the same kind and at least the level of care as is
          usual in the ordinary course of business. In doing so it shall, in
          particular, take adequate steps to protect confidential information
          against unauthorised disclosure, reproduction and use.
        </p>
        <p>
          11.2 This obligation to observe confidentiality shall not apply to
          information (a) which was demonstrably already known to the receiving
          party when it was disclosed or (b) was already generally obvious at
          this time, or to information (c) for which the receiving party proves
          that it has received this information from a third party without any
          obligation to observe confidentiality after this contract was
          concluded, on condition that this third party for its part did not
          infringe an obligation to the disclosing party to observe
          confidentiality by passing on the information, (d) in respect of which
          the receiving party proves that this information became generally
          obvious through no fault of the party in question after the contract
          was concluded or (e) must be disclosed on grounds of mandatory legal
          provisions, a non-appealable court judgment or an official order.
          MotorHub shall be entitled to forward the Client's confidential
          information to its Affiliates for the purpose of implementing this
          contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          11.3 The parties shall not publish any press information, press
          releases, interviews or other public statements in respect of the
          planned cooperation, or make them available to third parties, without
          the prior written (also via e-mail) consent of the other party. Each
          party may exercise its complete discretion in granting such consent.

          <strong>12. Limitation</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          All claims of the Client against MotorHub which arise from this
          contractual relationship with MotorHub shall become statute-barred
          after one year, starting with the end of the year in which the claim
          first arose and the Client became aware of the circumstances that
          justify the claim or must have become aware of them without gross
          negligence. This shall not apply in the case of any liability of
          MotorHub on grounds of intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>13. Miscellaneous</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          13.1 All agreements reached at the time of the contract being
          concluded or thereafter which diverge from the provisions of these GT
          &amp;Cs must be made in writing to be effective. This shall also apply
          to an annulment or waiver of the written form requirement. The parties
          are agreed that signed declarations sent by fax or scan via e-mail
          shall also satisfy the written form requirement. In particular, all
          individual contracts can also be sent by fax or scan via e-mail to
          MotorHub. Unless otherwise agreed, all other notifications within the
          scope of the implementation of this contract can be sent by e-mail (to
          the e-mail addresses specified to each other by the parties for these
          purposes). Verbal agreements and communication by telephone, on the
          other hand, shall not be sufficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.2 The Client shall be entitled to assign claims from its
          contractual relationship with MotorHub only after receiving prior
          written consent from MotorHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          13.3 The Client hereby declares its agreement that MotorHub can at any
          time transfer its rights and obligations arising from this contract
          either wholly (assumption of contract) or partly to its Affiliates. If
          the Client's legitimate interests are impaired by such a transfer, the
          Client can cancel this contract without notice as of the date when the
          transfer comes into effect.
