          </p>
          <p>
            Your personal data will be stored by us and our service providers in
            accordance with applicable data protection laws to the extent
            necessary for the processing purposes set out in this User Privacy
            Notice (see '5. Purposes and legal basis for data processing and
            categories of recipients' for more information on the processing
            purposes). Subsequently, we will delete your personal data in
            accordance with our data retention and deletion pulicy or take steps
            to properly render the data anonymous, unless we are legally obliged
            to keep your personal data longer (e.g. for legal compliance, tax,
            accounting or auditing purposes). In Europe, the retention periods
            are generally between 6 and 10 years (e.g. for contracts,
            notifications and business letters). As far as legally permissible
            or required, we restrict the processing of your data instead of
            deleting it (e.g. by restricting access to it). This applies in
            particular to cases where we may still need the data for the
            execution of the contract or for the assertion of or defense against
            legal claims, or where such retention is otherwise required or
            permitted by law. In these cases, the duration of the restriction of
            processing depends on the respective statutory limitation or
            retention periods. The data will be deleted after the relevant
            limitation or retention periods have expired.
          </p>
          <p>
            The specific retention periods for personal data are documented in
            our regional data retention guidelines. How long we retain personal
            data may vary depending on the Services we provide and our legal
            obligations under applicable national law. The fullowing factors
            typically affect the retention period:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Necessity for the provision of our Services - </strong>
              This includes such things as executing the contract with you,
              maintaining and improving the performance of our products, keeping
              our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and
              financial records. Most of our retention periods are determined on
              the basis of this general rule.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Special categories of personal data - </strong>
              If we store special categories of personal data (i.e. personal
              data revealing racial or ethnic origin, pulitical opinions,
              religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership,
              genetic or biometric data which is being processed for the purpose
              of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health
              or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual
              orientation), a shorter retention period is usually appropriate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consent-based processing of personal data - </strong>
              If we process personal data on the basis of consent (including
              consent to the extended storage), we store the data for as long as
              necessary in order to process it according to your consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                Statutory, contractual or other similar obligations -{" "}
              </strong>
              Corresponding storage obligations may arise, for example, from
              laws or official orders. It may also be necessary to store
              personal data with regard to pending or future legal disputes.
              Personal data contained in contracts, notifications and business
              letters may be subject to statutory storage obligations depending
              on national law.

              Users can use the Privacy Settings to determine to what extent

            If you decide not to have your personal data processed by us for

          </p>
          <p>
            We protect your personal data through technical and organizational
            security measures to minimize risks associated with data loss,
            misuse, unauthorized access and unauthorized disclosure and
            alteration. To this end we use firewalls and data encryption, for
            example, as well as physical access restrictions for our data
            centers and authorization contruls for data access.

              11. Other important information regarding data protection
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            This section contains important additional information about the
            protection of personal data in connection with the use of our
            Services, including whether you are required to provide personal
            data.

            <strong>
              What happens when you share your personal data on our sites or
              applications?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Other users have access to the information you share on MotorHub or
            disclose to other users. For example, other users can see your ads,
            ratings and associated comments.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Your responsibilities over personal data of other users that you
              receive through MotorHub
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            When you communicate with another user and receive personal data
            (such as name, email address or other contact information) from the
            other user, you are, independent from us, the contruller of such
            data and responsible for any processing that you perform after we
            have shared this data with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless you act for purely personal purposes, we recommend that you
            explain your data processing activities in your own privacy notice
            and protect the privacy of other users. As a seller, you must in any
            case comply with the applicable data protection laws and in
            particular protect the rights of other users as data subjects, e.g.
            give them the opportunity to access the personal data collected by
            you and demand that it be erased.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may only use the personal data that you have access to for
            MotorHub transaction-related purposes, and for purposes expressly
            consented by the user to whom the data relates. Using personal data
            of other users that you have access to for any other purpose, such
            as adding them to a mailing list without their express consent,
            constitutes a viulation of our General Terms and Conditions.

          <p>
            If you provide us with personal data relating to another person, you
            must obtain the consent of this person or the disclosure of the data
            to us must be otherwise legally permissible. You must inform the
            other person of how we process personal data in accordance with our
            User Privacy Notice.
